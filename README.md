# Traffic-and-Mobility-Data-Omdena

The datasets provided have been partially cleaned, I just want you all to have a look to see if these sets will be useful for our data before we do a full clean and join them with our main dataset.

I have traffic data for the Metrobus which travels through 4 stations: The linea/line column relates to the route they travel; the Metrobus has 7 Lines. 

For now our stations are on Line 3 (General Hospital, Miguel Hidalgo), Line 4 (Merced, Benito Juarez, Miguel Hidalgo) and Line 7 (Miguel Hidalgo). If someone has more current information on the Metrobus please update where needed.

Daily Metrobús Flow (Single): Has influx data from 2005 to present. 

Daily Metrobús Traffic (Broken Down): Has updated influx data from 2021 to present.

Metrobús Traffic Index (weekday average): Has a years worth of  Covid mobility data from 2020.

Sunday walk attendance/ Night walk assistance: Has mobility data related to bike usage on Sundays across 2 of our stations; Miguel Hidalgo, Benito Juárez. I'm not sure how relevant or useful this will be but I have added it just incase we decide to explore.

I've attached the website links for you to explore as there are more datasets availble however, I blieve these are the most relevant to our project for now.
